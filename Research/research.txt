1. Research major cybersecurity breaches over the past 20 years and pick one to write a short essay on.
    In January of 2021, tens of millions of Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn profiles were exposed to a massive cybersecurity breach by a company called, SocialArks. Due to Facebook's unsecured database, SocialArks was able to leak up to 400GB of personal identifiable information (PII) of some 214 million social media users, including influencers and celebrities. The unsecured ElasticSearch database was without password protection and/or encryption for these social media users from around the World. The lack of password protection or encryption on the server meant that anyone in possession of the server IP-address could have accessed the database containing millions of people’s private information.

    Since the cyberattack, Facebook has released numerous statements on improving the ElasticSearch server's invulnerability to future attacks with the use of encrypted files and password protection. Since the January 2021 attack, another attack in April of 2021 occurred leaking 533 million Facebook users information from 106 different countries. The released data includes Facebook users’ mobile numbers, name, gender, location, relationship status, occupation, date of birth and email addresses. “While Facebook has fixed the issue, the damage of exfiltration of sensitive data occurred before the vulnerability was fixed,” said Setu Kulkarni, the Vice President of strategy at WhiteHat Security. Facebook has reported the data leaked in this latest breach was "old" and "from a previous leak in 2019", assuring users their updated information is secure with encryption, password protection, and safety-net algorithims.
